  <h1>✍️ Welcome to my Creative Side! </h1>
  <p><strong>The spot for all things content! A portfolio showcasing my writing, editing, and design skills.</strong></p>
  <h2> 🧐 What to Expect</h2>
<p> This is where I keep my favorite writing and design samples!.</p>
<p> Everything from professional comms, tech stories, and purpose-driven content, to personal reflections and essays (because, shhh... writing feels easier than talking!).</p>
  <h2>📂 What's Inside?</h2>
  <p>Each folder WILL contain different resources, along with a <strong>Readme file</strong> to guide you on how to use/enjoy them effectively.</p>
  <h2>🚧 I'm still Working on it! </h2>
<p>This project is constantly growing, adapting, and changing—just like real-life projects! Stay tuned!</p>
